<h2 class="nobreak" id="EUROPEAN_EMIGRATION_TO_AMERICA">EUROPEAN EMIGRATION TO AMERICA,
AND ITS EFFECTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the greatest economic problems of our
time is associated with the double stream which
has been setting westward across the Atlantic
with steady persistence for some two or three
years, and which even now does not seem to have
passed its height. It is a stream which is composed
of the labour and the capital of the Old
World. To the number of many hundreds of
thousands of individuals, some of the best bone
and sinew of the European states has been transplanted
each year to America. And latterly, this
exodus has been accompanied by a large volume
of that without which labour can do little collectively.
During the last twelve months especially,
the number of schemes for the employment of
British capital across the Atlantic has increased
enormously; and at the present time, there are
many millions of money, belonging to people still
residing on this side, invested directly or indirectly
in land, and in industries connected with
land in the States of the Union and of Canada.
The receptivity of the American continent in
respect both of labour and of capital is very great;
but it is not unlimited. Nor is the supply of
either labour or capital unlimited in the countries
of the eastern hemisphere. There is not as yet
any imminent danger of excessive contribution in
the one case and of depletion in the other; but
we are within sight of consequences which it may
be well to consider.</p>

<p>And first with regard to Emigration. It must
not be supposed that America—and for the present
let us confine our attention to the United States—welcomes
without exception the human stream.
There are undoubtedly elements in it which
would be objectionable anywhere. There are
hordes of paupers and loafers and ne’erdoweels,
who are as little likely to do any good for themselves,
or to benefit the community, in the New
World as in the Old. But apart from these,
there has been a flow of shrewd workers and
skilled artisans, which a certain section of the
American nation is disposed to regard with
a sour look. The reason is not far to seek. The
dominant economic policy of America has been,
as we know, one of strict protection of their own
industries. For the benefit of the few, the many
are heavily burdened, in the belief—fallacious,
and not always genuinely entertained—that in
process of time the many will reap the harvest.
The conductors of these domestic industries are
glad enough to get all the experienced foreign
labour they can; but the domestic labourer says,
very naturally, that the importation is unjust to
him. He says, in effect: ‘You tax foreign products
to shut out competition with yourselves;
but you admit freely foreign producers to compete
with me. You raise the cost of living to me by
the imposition of taxes to foster your trades; yet
you reduce my means of living by suffering immigration
which tends to reduce the level of wages.’
Here is friction, and friction which is already
producing sparks. It is not difficult to foresee
the result. The working-classes cannot continue
to burn the candle at both ends for ever. It is
not practicable for any country in these days to
prohibit, or even to restrict, the importation of
human beings. Nor can America say: ‘We will
receive any number of farm-labourers, or miners,
or anybody disposed to squat in the backwoods
and open up our country; but we will draw the
line at mechanics or any form of skilled labour
which we can ourselves produce to the extent of
our requirements.’ The effect of the supply of
foreign labour would have been more apparent
ere this but for the suicidal policy of the American
trades-unions, which practically prohibit the
evolution of domestic skill, by forbidding apprenticeship
to crafts. But, nevertheless, the effect
must eventually be to diminish ‘the reward of
labour.’</p>

<p>A well-known American writer holds that the
increase in the number of labourers does not
<i>tend</i> to diminish wages, but the converse. What
in his opinion causes the tendency of ‘the reward
of labour’ to a minimum in spite of increase in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">{642}</span>
producing-power, is that rent increases in a still
greater ratio. The result is much the same, as far
as the labourer is concerned, and it proceeds,
whether directly, as is commonly held, or indirectly,
as the American writer holds, from there
being three men to house and feed where there
had been only two. If, however, it be really the
matter of rent or interest which affects the price of
labour, then the American citizen has all the more
reason to regard with attention the other portion
of the stream, namely, the flow of British capital
for investment in land and cattle in the West. We
do not know the aggregate capital of the numerous
Ranche and other Companies which have been
lately formed, but it is enormous; and with private
investments as well, the total British capital
occupied in them cannot be short of twenty
millions sterling, and probably is even considerably
more. The actual amount is not material to
our argument. The effect of this tremendous
diversion of capital is twofold. It is increasing
the value of older estates by the absorption of
cheap competitive lots, and it is arousing in the
Americans themselves a species of earth-hunger
which promises to be very keen. There are
thoughtful, observing men on the other side
of the Atlantic, who, noting the disfavour
into which investments in railroads have fallen,
because of their comparatively poor returns—and
also because of the distrust begotten by
their scandalous management—and who noting,
also, the rapidity with which English capital is
leading the way—predict that America is on
the eve of the most tremendous land ‘boom’
ever known. That means, in plain English, that
the enhancement in the value of land, legitimately
produced by settlement and cultivation—in other
words, by the employment of actual capital and
labour—will have an artificial enhancement of
indefinite extent added to it <i>by the action of speculation</i>.
In all commodities dealt in by man,
there is an intrinsic value and a speculative value.
When the speculative value becomes inflated
above the level of intrinsic value, there ensues
a period of dangerous excitement, which invariably
ends in collapse and disaster. This is
especially the case with land, and it is precisely
towards such a critical time that America seems
verging.</p>

<p>All this, however, seems to us to point to the
probability of free-trade becoming ere long the
watchword of the working-classes in the United
States. With free-trade in labour concurrently
with land-speculation, subjecting them to diminution
of wages, and at the same time increase in the
cost of living, they will have no alternative but
to demand the free admission of all materials
bearing on their industries and affecting the cost
of living. It is possible that in the present great
land-movement may be germinating the seeds of
the next great commercial crisis; and upon the
theory of periodicity, one of these crises will be
due in a year or two. So, also, it is probable that
the Emigration movement from the east has
carried and is carrying with it elements which
will aid in bringing about the much to be desired
future of free-trade.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LI.—HEY, PRESTO!</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Coutts</span> having seen that his father and sisters
were provided with all necessary comforts,
hastened to the city. He had an appointment
which could not be postponed; he could do
nothing more at Ringsford; in town he could
arrange with some contractor to send out a band
of men to make the least injured portion of the
Manor again habitable, and to clear away the
débris as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The appointment was to meet Philip and
Wrentham at Mr Shield’s apartments. Coutts
was confident that the bill he held was a forgery.
He had no doubt Philip had been fooled into
it somehow, but that was no reason why <i>he</i>
should be fooled out of it. The way Shield had
received him plainly indicated that he would
give him no place in his will; whilst he was
anxious to avoid scandal which would involve
Philip.</p>

<p>‘Well, if the old fellow won’t give me a
slice of his fortune, I’ll screw a plum out of
it,’ was Coutts’s agreeable reflection. ‘I have the
forged bill, and unless he hands me over double
the amount, I don’t give it up.’</p>

<p>That was a ‘smart’ stroke of business, which
delighted Coutts almost as much as the prospect
of gaining such a large sum of money, and of
making the ‘old fellow’ stump up in spite of
himself. There was, too, in his mind a kind of
moral fitness in the transaction; for it would
be paying out this precious uncle for some of
the annoyance he had caused his father. In addition,
there was to be reckoned the satisfaction of
outwitting one of the cutest scamps he had come
across—a fellow who had overreached even him—for
with the same move which was to checkmate
Shield, Wrentham would be paid out too. He
gave little consideration to his brother, having
no doubt that he would escape all right somehow.</p>

<p>He had secured the services of a detective who
possessed the highest qualifications for his office,
namely, he was not like a detective at all in
manner, appearance or speech. Meeting Sergeant
Dier in an ordinary way, you would regard him
as a successful commercial man. There was not
the slightest flavour of Scotland Yard about him.
He was a good actor, a good singer, and a capital
story-teller. Some of his most important discoveries
were made whilst he was entertaining
a roomful of company with his merry anecdotes.
The secret of his success lay partly in a natural
gift for his business, his enthusiasm, and the
good-nature which underlay it all. He never
allowed a scoundrel to escape; but he dealt
very gently with any poor creature who might
be betrayed into a first crime.</p>

<p>When Coutts reached his office, Sergeant Dier
was waiting for him. Any one looking at the
detective as he stood, bareheaded, reading a newspaper,
would have imagined that he was one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">{643}</span>
the bank officials. He accompanied Coutts to
his private room.</p>

<p>‘Well, what news have you?’</p>

<p>‘Our man has everything prepared for a
holiday abroad,’ was Dier’s smiling reply.</p>

<p>‘Can he get away?’</p>

<p>‘O dear, no; he is at present under the eye of
one of my friends, and he has been obliged to
delay his departure until to-morrow, owing to
a difficulty he has found in collecting his funds
on such short notice.’</p>

<p>‘Is that all?’</p>

<p>‘There is a little more,’ said Dier complacently.
‘I have found a man who can identify his writing
under any disguise.’</p>

<p>‘Who is he?’</p>

<p>‘Our man’s brother. It was not easy to persuade
him to help us, but he consented at the
last moment, and is to meet us at Mr Shield’s
place.’</p>

<p>‘Capital,’ said Coutts. ‘You understand, I do
not wish to proceed to extremities unless we are
forced to it.’</p>

<p>‘So you informed me; but the case is turning
out such a pretty one that it would have been
an honour to explain it in court.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind the honour; we’ll balance that
somehow. I shall be ready in twenty minutes,
and will meet you at the hotel.’</p>

<p>Sergeant Dier bowed and left. Outside the
room he nodded and smiled to himself as he
placed a glossy hat jauntily on his head.
Mentally and cheerfully he was saying: ‘I don’t
care about that chap—not much. I should not
be surprised to find him coming my way sometime
with the positions changed.’</p>

<p>Coutts examined letters, signed papers brought
to him by his chief clerk, and punctually at
the expiration of twenty minutes was on his
way to Mr Shield’s hotel. At the door he found
Sergeant Dier and Bob Tuppit waiting. The
poor little conjurer was nervous, and evidently
required all the robust encouragement of the
good-natured detective to sustain him in going
through with the task he had been persuaded
to undertake.</p>

<p>They were immediately conducted to Mr
Shield’s sitting-room. Coutts was a little surprised
and not pleased to find that Philip and
Wrentham had arrived before him; and beside
Mr Shield stood Mr Beecham—for whom he entertained
an instinctive dislike, not to mention
that on the few occasions of their meeting his
wittiest cynicisms had been silenced by the quiet
searching gaze of the elder man.</p>

<p>Philip had not yet heard of the previous night’s
events at Ringsford. He was pale, but calm,
and he greeted his brother somewhat coldly.
Wrentham was apparently at ease and playing
his part of devoted and therefore anxious friend
to perfection. He had not yet caught sight of
Bob Tuppit, who easily hid himself behind the
broad shoulders of Sergeant Dier.</p>

<p>‘I expected,’ said Coutts after formal salutations,
‘to have had the pleasure of a few minutes’
private conversation with you, Mr Shield, before
we proceeded with this disagreeable business.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think it necessary,’ answered Shield
in his brusque way.</p>

<p>‘As you will, sir,’ continued Coutts with a
slight inclination of the head. ‘I have brought
with me two persons who will, I believe, aid
us materially in the inquiry we are about to
make.’</p>

<p>‘Who are they?’ was the blunt query, indicating
Mr Shield’s usual impatience of palaver.</p>

<p>‘This is Mr Dier, who is interested on my
behalf; and this’——</p>

<p>‘Is a friend of mine,’ interposed Dier blandly,
‘who is an expert in distinguishing handwriting.’</p>

<p>Wrentham was the only one who showed surprise
at these introductions, and he moved a little
backward at sight of Bob Tuppit, covering his
uneasiness by a slight cough, as if clearing his
throat. Shield looked at Beecham, and the latter
spoke.</p>

<p>‘A very good idea, Mr Hadleigh, and as I have
some acquaintance with Mr Tuppit, I can vouch
for his ability to discharge any task he undertakes.
I presume you have shown him specimens
of the different handwritings?’</p>

<p>‘I do not understand your position in this
affair, Mr Beecham,’ said Coutts superciliously;
‘I can only address myself to Mr Shield, or if
he chooses, I can retire, and let the matter take
the ordinary legal course.’</p>

<p>‘I am here as the friend of Mr Shield,’ was the
reply, without the least symptom of irritation
at the manner and words of Coutts.</p>

<p>‘You can speak to him as you would to me,’
growled Shield.</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well,’ said Coutts, shrugging his
shoulders. ‘I thought you wanted to keep the
affair as quiet as possible. But, please yourself.
Then, I have not submitted any writing to
Mr Tuppit, whose name I learn from Mr Beecham.
He, being perfectly acquainted with the penmanship
of one of the persons concerned, I thought
it would be more satisfactory to you to have
the investigation made in your presence.’</p>

<p>He glanced at Wrentham as he spoke, and
that gentleman assumed an air of curiosity and
interest.</p>

<p>‘Begin with Tuppit at once: that will cut the
thing short,’ said Shield, as if already impatient
of the delay caused by these preliminaries.</p>

<p>‘Then here is a sheet of paper which Mr
Shield has already signed,’ said Mr Beecham.
‘Will you put down your name, Mr Philip,
and you, Mr Wrentham?’</p>

<p>They signed at once, and there was no reluctance
apparent on the part of either, but the
grand flourish which Wrentham was in the
habit of drawing under his signature was not
quite so steady as usual.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ proceeded Mr Beecham, ‘here is a
scrap of paper on which Mr Shield has written
a few words. Will you both write something
on separate slips, and that will enable us to
test Mr Tuppit’s skill in distinguishing the
writers.’</p>

<p>This having been done, the sheet bearing the
three signatures was first given to Tuppit, and
it shook slightly in his hand as he advanced
to the window to inspect it carefully. He then
laid the paper on the table.</p>

<p>‘I think I know the character of the writings
now,’ he said.</p>

<p>The three slips were next handed to him,
and he named the writer of each correctly.</p>

<p>‘Clever chap—knows what he is about,’ was
Shield’s comment. Then looking almost fiercely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">{644}</span>
at Coutts: ‘Suppose you have brought <i>your</i> paper
with you?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly.’</p>

<p>‘Show it then, and let us hear what he has
to say about it.’</p>

<p>Coutts slowly took out his pocket-book and
looked inquiringly at Sergeant Dier. The latter
had been observing the whole proceedings with
that kind of interest which a skilful player
bestows on an exciting game at cards or billiards.
He responded promptly to Coutts’s look.</p>

<p>‘Best thing you can do, sir. It will settle the
whole business at once.’</p>

<p>But Coutts did not want to settle the whole
business until he had spoken to Shield in private,
and explained the terms on which publicity might
be avoided. So he put in a hypocritical protest
which he hoped would aid him in making his
bargain by-and-by.</p>

<p>‘You are aware, Mr Shield, that there are
reasons why I do not wish this matter to go
beyond ourselves; and I believe you have the
same desire. On that account we need not
regard Mr Tuppit’s decision as final.’</p>

<p>‘I shall,’ answered Shield, frowning. ‘Hand
him the paper.’</p>

<p>Coutts obeyed with the reluctant air of one
who is compelled to do something he dislikes. He
did not look at Philip, who was watching him
with pitying eyes.</p>

<p>‘It is rather a serious thing, gentlemen,’ said
Tuppit, speaking for the first time, and now as
coolly as if he were on his conjuring platform,
‘a very serious thing to give a decided opinion
in a case of this sort without very careful examination.
You will permit me to compare the
signatures on this paper with the writing on the
different papers you showed me.’ He gathered
them up in his hand as he spoke. ‘I must use
a magnifying glass.’</p>

<p>He whipped one out from the tail-pocket of
his coat. Then with its aid he carefully compared
the writings. After ten minutes he rose,
and instead of giving his decision, he advanced to
Philip with the bill in his hand.</p>

<p>‘That is your signature,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘It is,’ replied Philip, quietly.</p>

<p>Coutts gave a slight shake of the head, as if
this was no more than he expected although he
deplored it. Wrentham’s eyes moved restlessly

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ILLICIT_DISTILLATION_IN_IRELAND">ILLICIT DISTILLATION IN IRELAND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mountainous districts in the north of Ireland
have long been famous for the manufacture of
whisky—or as it is sometimes called when made
without the concurrence of the revenue, ‘poteen.’
Until the last few years, the practice was exceedingly
common, even within a few miles of towns
of considerable size; but latterly the total output
of spirits has been much reduced in quantity,
and has been of inferior quality. Various causes
have contributed to this. Formerly, the excise
supervision was not so efficient as it has since
become. Very often, Englishmen or Scotchmen
were selected for Irish districts, and found the
peasantry combined to a man against them.
They were aided, too, by a body of police whose
sole duties were the detection and exposure of
frauds against the revenue, and therefore it was
a clear issue between two parties, with a large
body of spectators standing neutral, or rather,
in the national spirit, strongly sympathising with
those who were trying to evade the law. Besides,
if the Squire—who was of course a magistrate—found
an anonymous present of a five-gallon jar
of poteen, why should he go and waste good
liquor by giving it up, and perhaps by so doing
get some of his own tenants into trouble! It
was clearly none of his business; in which opinion
his neighbours heartily shared, as they sipped
it in punch at his festive board. The priest,
too, was of the same mind; for as long as the
‘boys’ did not take too much, or beat their
wives, or neglect attending mass, it was a very
convenient way of turning an honest penny in
those hard times. With the tacit concurrence
of these two great social forces, the owner of the
still had little to fear, and could carry on his
lawless trade with comparative impunity. The
possession of a common secret encouraged cordial
relations between all classes and creeds, until
they resembled the proverbial happy family. But
the events of the last thirty years have changed
all this, and have indirectly led to a large
diminution of private distillation.</p>

<p>The first blow which it received was the disbanding
of the revenue police about the year
1858, and the absorption of their duties, and
the drafting of the most capable members of
the force into the Royal Irish Constabulary.
This body have a great many duties to perform:
they keep the peace; act as public prosecutors
in petty cases; distribute and collect the census
papers and votes for poor-law guardians; make
up the agricultural statistics; act as an armed
drilled force in time of riot; and lastly, as
detectives of crime and, since 1858, of illicit
distillation. On account of these numerous functions,
they are brought into contact with almost
every individual in their district, not so much
at the barracks as at their own homes; and the
sight of an empty jar in an unlikely place, or
an unusual abundance of spirits about a particular
house, are signs not lost on the vigilant
constable, and carefully stored up by him for
future use.</p>

<p>Again, the improved means of transit in the
mountainous districts have given the affairs of
the inhabitants more publicity. Post-vans, mail-cars,
and narrow-gauge railways, are everywhere
furnishing certain and regular communication
between the better populated and more civilised
valleys and the poorer and less inhabited mountains.
By these means, enterprising travellers
have penetrated the backward districts, and been
received with the customary hospitality of the
Irish to strangers. They are occasionally even
permitted to taste the native ‘mountain dew,’
and sometimes thoughtlessly bring their entertainers
into trouble by incautiously boasting of
their privileges before strangers. The information
has been carried to the police force in the
district in which the, alas! too confiding host
resided, and has caused a watch to be set on
him, resulting eventually in the discovery of
the fountain-head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">{645}</span></p>

<p>But information of this kind is accidental, and
therefore such cases are rare. The fact is that
the chief sources of knowledge are, as might
be expected from the analogy of other Irish conspiracies,
from within the camp, which is sure to
hold sooner or later some informer. A difference
of opinion about the division of the spoil, a row
amongst their womankind, or some such characteristic
quarrel, leads to ill-feeling, and some
impulsive member of the gang, in the haste of
momentary spite, secretly informs the police.
Then the customary and well-known scene follows.
A force of constabulary fully armed steals
out under cover of night, carefully surround the
fated still-house, and advancing from all sides,
simultaneously burst in upon the unfortunate distillers
just as the outlying scout has brought word
that the police are coming. Resistance, though
sometimes attempted, is useless, and the dread
guardians of the law proceed to destroy the prepared
materials, seize the still, and quench the fire.
Finally, the sad procession of police, prisoners,
and utensils—the last being placed in a cart
with the manufactured spirits—wends its way
down the mountain-side to the nearest barracks.
Then, at the next petty sessions of the district,
all those who were found engaged, together with
the tenant on whose holding the distillation was
being carried on, are heavily fined, with the
option of a severe term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>But what has conduced more than anything
else to the diminution of illicit distillation has
been successive bad harvests, rack-renting, and
absentee landlords. These have produced agrarian
outrages, and these in their turn have led to
Coercion Acts, giving the constabulary night-patrol
powers of a very comprehensive character.
As the mountainous districts are the poorest, so
the outrages have been more frequent there, and
the police in seeking for those intent on committing
crime, have often accidentally found
those merely intent on distilling poteen. All
these discoveries are treasured up, and care taken
that the same practice will not again occur in
the same place; and thus the opportunities for
illicit distillation are gradually becoming fewer
and fewer, and everything seems to point towards
its total extinction.</p>

<p>The place selected for the operations of the
distiller is usually some natural hollow, or a
sheltered spot partially hidden by some overhanging
rock. But occasionally there are much
more habitable places prepared. A favourite
example of this is an artificial cave dug out in
the side of a high bank close to a stream, the
proximity of which is always necessary for their
operations. The entrance is generally concealed
with great ingenuity by a luxuriant growth of
furze and other shrubs. Inside, a raised seat of
earth, on which some heather has been strewn,
and a rudely built chimney, complete the structure.
The functions of the chimney are not by
any means exhausted by being brought up to
the natural level of the earth. As is well known,
burning peat has an easily recognisable odour,
and if this drew attention to a wreath of smoke
ascending in the midst of a field, the chances
of a long life for the still-house would be
very small. Instead, therefore, of being directly
brought out, every conceivable artifice is employed
to render the smoke invisible. Sometimes
it is led into a drain; at others, into a
thick growth of underwood; again, it is carried
for some distance, and allowed to make its escape
in such small quantities as to be practically imperceptible.
In one case of which we knew,
the still-house was underground in the vicinity
of the owner’s cottage, and advantage of this was
taken to convey the chimney up the earthen
fence and effect a junction with the flue of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>In some cases, a dwelling-house is chosen in
such a locality as to defy suspicion. An example
of this occurred in a market-town where distillation
was carried on for many years in the main
street within a hundred yards of an important
constabulary barracks, and the owner in this
case was said to have amassed a considerable
amount of money. For aught that is known,
many similar instances may still exist, as the
shrewdness shown by the choice of such a hiding-place
renders detection, except through treachery,
a most unlikely event. It would be well perhaps
to add, that in the case just related the proprietor
of the still was a bachelor.</p>

<p>Having prepared a suitable place, the next
thing is to procure a still and worm, which are
usually manufactured by the local tinker. The
still is generally made of strong tinned plate,
and is of a cylindrical form, except the head,
which is rounded and enlarged, in order to better
collect the alcohol as it evaporates. The highest
part of the head terminates in a tube, wide at
first, but gradually becoming narrower, until it
reaches the worm, which is a long tube curled
into a spiral, and during work is always kept
cold by immersion in water. It is sometimes
made from tinned plate, but preferably of sheet-copper,
as this material, in some mysterious way,
is said to make better poteen.</p>

<p>The still having been procured, the materials
from which the spirit is extracted must be
obtained. Malt is, of course, the most important
item, but in past times was very difficult to
procure, as part of the excise officer’s labours,
until the repeal of the malt tax, was to prevent
its preparation in corn-mills, so that the still-owner
had frequently to choose between making
it for himself with imperfect appliances, or
using an inferior substitute. This was either
ordinary grain or treacle, generally the latter,
from its portability, and the quickness with
which it could be prepared. Indeed, the extra
sale of treacle in particular districts has been a
very trustworthy indication of the quantity of
spirits being manufactured. In one village where
some years ago the average sale was three casks
a week, the present consumption is not more
than one every two months. But perhaps this
may result as much from the repeal of the malt
tax as the decline in illicit distillation.</p>

<p>The malt or treacle is laid down in water
somewhat under boiling-point, and allowed to
remain there until it has attained to the consistence
of thin water-gruel. It is now ready
for fermentation, which is effected by means of
yeast; and when this process is complete, the
mixture is called ‘wash,’ and is now ready for
distillation. The still is now filled with wash,
and a gentle heat applied, vaporising the alcohol,
which passes through the still-head, and is cooled
back to its liquid form in the worm, at the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">{646}</span>
end of which it is received by pans, crocks,
‘piggins,’ or indeed any vessel which will hold
it. From these receptacles it is put into jars
or casks—more commonly five-gallon ‘kegs’—and
conveyed to a place of safety. When all the
wash has been distilled, the articles employed are
carefully hidden, a favourite place for the still
and worm being under water in the neighbouring
stream. Then nothing remains but the distribution
of the spirits in such a manner as to
realise a handsome profit. This is an operation
demanding all the craft of the distiller. To
dispose of it to his immediate neighbours would
be to disclose his secret, and they would either
demand the poteen for nothing, or denounce
him if he refused to give it. It must therefore
be conveyed to a distance, and sold to some
publican at such a price as will amply compensate
both parties for their risk. As the publican must
keep a record of all the spirits he receives, he
incurs the danger of having material on his premises
which is not entered in his stock-book; as a
rule, therefore, the poteen is mixed with whisky
resembling it in flavour, and the blend sold as
the original.</p>

<p>In order to get the jar or cask safely into the
town, the distiller usually envelops it in straw
or hay, and tries to pass it off as innocent fodder;
or another plan is to place it in the centre of a
cart of turf, and on selling the turf to the proper
person, its removal is easy, though occasionally
even more ingenious methods are resorted to.</p>

<p>Fortunes acquired by means of illicit distillation
have given rise to a very curious taunt
amongst the inhabitants of the north-west of
Ireland. When it was intended to convey to
any person in the strongest possible manner that
his pride in his family circumstances was only
that of an upstart, the common expression for
this was: ‘Your grandmother was Doherty ——,
and wore a tin pocket.’ The origin of this
saying was as follows. The northern part of the
county of Donegal, particularly the district of
Innishowen, is largely peopled by persons of the
name of Doherty and O’Doherty. In past times,
one of the best means of smuggling poteen into
Londonderry and other towns in the vicinity was
by a tin flask carried by the women in their
pockets. Hence the expression.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Mr Ridsdale and Miss Loraine found
themselves alone, they seated themselves on the
rustic seat lately vacated by the vicar and Dr
M‘Murdo. Master Archie lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>Clarice Loraine at this time had just left her
nineteenth birthday behind her. She was tall
and limber as any fabled nymph of the woods,
with an easy, swaying grace in all her movements
such as Art alone could never have taught her.
She had a cloud of silky, pale-gold hair, that
looked as if some sportive zephyr had ruffled
it in passing; while her eyes were of the deepest
and tenderest blue. Her habitual expression
was one of sweet seriousness, of most gentle
gravity; but when she smiled, which she did
often, she smiled both with her lips and her eyes:
it was like the lighting up of a beautiful landscape
with a sudden flash of sunshine.</p>

<p>And the young man to whom she had given
away her heart? Well, he was a stalwart, good-looking
enough young fellow, about twenty-five
years old, with dark-brown hair, and a moustache
to match; with frank, clear-gazing eyes, which
looked as if nothing in the world could cause
them to flinch; in short, one of those manly,
clear-skinned, resolute-looking young Englishmen
of whom those who choose may see scores any
day during the season in London town.</p>

<p>‘Are you sure, darling, that you are not too
tired to go on the lake this evening?’ asked
Archie presently.</p>

<p>‘I am just a little tired now; but I shall not
be a bit tired when the time comes to start. To-night
it will be full moon.’</p>

<p>Archie looked at his watch. ‘The afternoon
post will be in in about half an hour. I wonder
whether it will bring us anything from the
pater?’</p>

<p>‘O Archie, if it should bring a letter from
your father in which he orders you to give me
up!’</p>

<p>‘As if I had not told you a hundred times
already that I am not going to give you up for
any one in the wide world!’</p>

<p>‘It would make me ever, ever so unhappy
to think that I should come as an obstacle
between your father and you.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a little goose. I’m old enough to
choose a wife for myself; and I’ve chosen you,
and mean to have you in spite of everybody.
If the pater chooses to turn rusty about it, I
can’t help it. He did the very same thing when
he was a young fellow. He ran away with my
mother—oh, I’ve heard all about it!—and I’m
not aware that he ever had cause to regret having
done so. Of course it would be pleasanter—a
jolly sight pleasanter—to have his consent and
good wishes and all that; but if he won’t give
us them, I daresay we shall be able to get along
somehow or other without them. There are
worse things in the world than poverty, when
two people love each other as you and I love
each other, sweet one.’</p>

<p>What bold beings are these lovers! Nothing
daunts them. They will take the world by
storm and set Fortune herself at defiance. A
very Paladin seemed Archie in the eyes of the
girl who loved him. How beautifully he spoke—what
noble sentiments fell from his lips!</p>

<p>‘I am not afraid to face poverty or anything
else,’ she murmured, ‘so long as I know that you
care for me.’ Tears trembled in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘And that I shall never, never cease to do!’ he
responded fervently.</p>

<p>He had sidled a little closer to her on the
rustic bench, and he now tried, after a fashion
old as the hills, to insinuate one arm gently
round her waist.</p>

<p>‘No—no, Archie, dear, you must not do that!
We are not alone. Although that young curate
pretends to be reading, he’s watching us all the
time.’</p>

<p>‘Confound his impudence!’ growled Archie
with a glance over his shoulder at the obnoxious
individual. Then he drew exactly an inch and
a half further away, and proceeded to light a
fresh cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">{647}</span></p>

<p>The fact was that, after the immemorial fashion
of lovers, our two young lunatics had been so
absorbed in themselves and their own affairs
that they had had no eyes to note the fresh
arrivals which the last steamer had brought to
the hotel. One of these was a young man
dressed in the garb of a modern curate. The
afternoon was hot, and as he came slowly up
the path that led from the level of the lake
to the elevated ground on which the hotel was
built, he fanned himself with the broad brim of
his low-crowned felt hat. Behind him marched
a porter carrying a bulky portmanteau, a mackintosh,
and an exceedingly slim umbrella.</p>

<p>A little way from the path stood an immense
elm, round the bole of which a seat had been
fixed for the convenience of visitors. It looked
cool and tempting; the young man glanced at
it and hesitated.</p>

<p>‘Why go indoors just yet?’ he asked himself.
Then turning to the porter, he said: ‘Take
those traps into the hotel and secure a bedroom
for me. Then find out whether you have a
Lady Renshaw and a Miss Wynter staying in
the hotel, and come back at once and let me
know.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir—Lady Renshaw and Miss Wynter.—What
name shall I have put down for the
bedroom—your name, sir?’</p>

<p>‘My name? Um. By-the-bye, what <i>is</i> my
name?’ the young man asked himself in some
perplexity. Then his face brightened, and he
said impressively: ‘My name is Mr Golightly.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir—the Reverend Mr Golightly.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir’—with severity—‘not the Reverend
Mr Golightly. Plain Mr Golightly—of London.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. Plain Mr Golightly. I’ll be sure
not to forget. Back in five minutes, sir.’ Mr
Golightly went and sat down in the welcome
shade of the elm.</p>

<p>‘I’m fairly in for it now,’ he muttered. ‘I’ve
passed the Rubicon, and there’s no going back.
If they are not here already, they will be sure to
arrive by the next train. Will Bella recognise
me in this rig-out, I wonder? Upon my word,
I don’t think she will.’</p>

<p>Presently the porter came back. ‘No ladies
stopping here by the name you spoke of, sir,’
said the man.</p>

<p>‘At what hour is the table-d’hôte?’</p>

<p>‘At seven o’clock, sir.—Got you a very nice
bedroom, sir—splendid view across the lake.
No. 65, sir.’</p>

<p>‘When is the next train due in from
London?’</p>

<p>‘One about due in now, sir. The drive from
the station takes about twenty minutes. Thank
ye, sir.’</p>

<p>‘About twenty minutes; I may as well wait
here,’ remarked Mr Golightly to himself as soon
as the man had left him. ‘This will be a capital
“coign of vantage” from which to spot the
arrivals.’</p>

<p>He yawned, crossed his legs, and produced
from his pocket a soberly bound little volume,
which might have been a volume of sermons,
only it was not. He read a page or two, then
he yawned again, and then he shut up the
book.</p>

<p>‘No, not even Alphonse Daudet has power to
charm me this afternoon. Will she come?—will
she not come? Does she love me?—does she
not love me? Upon my word, I’m in a regular
fever; pulse about a hundred and twenty to
the minute. I wonder why they can’t inoculate
one for love, the same as they do for other things.
A mild attack for about a week, and then we
should get over it for life.’</p>

<p>Suddenly he started and threw a keen look
at the two young people some little distance
away, whom he had scarcely noticed before.
‘Archie Ridsdale, by all that’s wonderful!
I’ve not seen him for a century. Does Lady
Renshaw know that he’s here, I wonder? and
is she dragging Bella down to this place that
she may try to catch the rich baronet’s son
for her niece’s husband? It’s just like one
of her ladyship’s moves. Well, I’m not going
to worry myself with jealousy. Besides, somebody
at the club said that Archie had engaged
himself to a girl without a penny. I wonder
whether that is the demoiselle in question.
She looks pretty enough to turn any fellow’s head.’</p>

<p>Mr Golightly whistled softly to himself for a
minute or two; then he muttered: ‘Wretched
slow work watching another fellow spoon and not
be able to join in the fun one’s self! That must
be the girl. By Jove! Master Archie seems about
as hard hit as I am.’</p>

<p>This latter remark was elicited by the sight
of Mr Ridsdale sidling up to Miss Loraine with
the evident intention of encircling her waist
with his arm; but, as we have already seen, he
was very properly repulsed. Presently Clarice
rose and gathered up her heap of ferns and
grasses.</p>

<p>‘You are not going indoors already, Clarice?’</p>

<p>‘Already! Commend me to your sex for
being unreasonable. A pretty scolding I shall
get from Mora for having been out so long.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe Madame De Vigne could scold
any one, were she to try ever so much.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t know her. She has a terrible
temper. It runs in the family.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad you have told me. I shall be
prepared for the worst.—We shall meet again
at the table-d’hôte; meanwhile, I’ll go and look
after the postman.’</p>

<p>‘Should there be a letter, you will let me
know as soon as possible?’</p>

<p>‘Never fear.’</p>

<p>With a smile and a nod, she left him, and
speeding across the lawn, entered the hotel by
a French-window, one of a number which stood
wide open this sunny afternoon.</p>

<p>Archie gazed after her admiringly till she was
out of sight. Then he buried his hands in his
pockets and turned and sauntered slowly up
towards the main entrance to the hotel.</p>

<p>‘Ah! here’s Ridsdale coming this way,’ exclaimed
Mr Golightly. ‘Wonder whether he’ll
know me? What larks!’</p>

<p>But Mr Ridsdale was thinking his own thoughts,
and he passed Mr Golightly, who was apparently
deep in the perusal of his sober-looking volume,
as though there was no such person in existence.
But he had not got more than a few yards beyond
the tree when he heard himself called.</p>

<p>‘Archie, dear!’ cried some one softly. If it were
not a feminine voice that spoke, it was a very
good imitation of one.</p>

<p>Mr Ridsdale started, and turned. Beyond two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">{648}</span>
or three loungers round the door of the hotel,
some distance away, not a creature was visible
save the clerical-looking young man seated under
the tree and intent on his book.</p>

<p>Archie’s eyes struck fire and his face flamed
suddenly. He advanced three or four paces.
‘Did you address that remark to me, sir?’ he
sternly demanded.</p>

<p>‘Of course I did, sir,’ answered Mr Golightly,
looking up innocently in the other’s face. Then
before Archie’s wrath had time to explode, he
flung down his book and started laughingly to
his feet. ‘Ridsdale, old chappie, how de do?’
he exclaimed. ‘Awfully glad to meet you. Don’t
you know me?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, I do not know you,’ answered Archie
with a cold stare. ‘Never saw you before in my
life, that I’m aware of.’</p>

<p>‘What! Not recollect Dick Dulcimer?’</p>

<p>‘Dick Dulcimer! You!’ eyeing him from
top to toe. ‘It can’t be.’</p>

<p>‘But it is—at least I’ve every reason to believe
so, and <i>I</i> think I ought to know.’</p>

<p>‘But’——, and again he eyed him critically
over.</p>

<p>‘Why this thusness, you would ask. I’ll
explain in a few words. But sit down for a
minute or two; it’s too hot to stand.—You
remember Bella Wynter?’</p>

<p>‘Rather. One of the prettiest girls out, the
season before last. I was nearly a gone coon in
that quarter myself.’</p>

<p>‘Well—I’m quite a gone coon.’</p>

<p>‘Glad to hear it. Congratulate you, old
man.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the old story, of course. I’ve next to
nothing, Bella has less. There’s a dragon in the
path in the shape of Lady Renshaw, Bella’s aunt.
But probably you remember her ladyship?’—Mr
Ridsdale nodded.—‘Well, she detests me, and has
set her heart on Bella marrying money.’</p>

<p>‘Of course. But what has Miss Wynter herself
to say in the matter?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I think Bella likes me—a little; in fact,
I’ve not much doubt on that point, although,
like the young person in the play, I’ve never
told my love. But she has been brought up to
think it a crime to marry a poor beggar without
a fortune, and then she’s so completely under the
dowager’s thumb that she dare scarcely call her
bonnet her own. The Fates only know how it
will end.’</p>

<p>‘And you are down here?’——</p>

<p>‘To meet them. I expect them by the next
train. Bella corresponds with my sister, and
Madge gave me the hint. I got a fortnight’s leave,
and made up my mind to follow them; but apparently
I’m here first. Of course it would never
have done to let Lady R. find me here; she
would have taken the alarm at once, and have
carried off Bella by the next train. What was
to be done? All at once it struck me that I had
lately been playing the part of a curate in some
amateur theatricals in town. A month hence we
are going to play the same comedietta again for
another charity, so that, as it happened, I had
the togs, obtained for the first performance, still
by me. I shaved off my beard and moustache,
had my hair and eyebrows dyed black, donned
my clerical garb, took a ticket from Euston, and
here I am.’</p>

<p>‘Your own mother wouldn’t know you if she
were to meet you.’</p>

<p>‘Not much fear of the dowager recognising me,
eh?’ asked Mr Dulcimer with a chuckle. Then
he added more seriously: ‘If I can only get
Bella to myself for an hour while she’s down
here—there was no chance of it in town—I’ll
know my fate one way or the other. She’s an
arrant young flirt, I know; but I’ll have no
more of her shilly-shallying; she shall give me
a plain Yes or a plain No.’</p>

<p>‘I commend your resolution, and wish you
every success with the fair Bella. Of course your
secret is quite safe in my hands, and if I can do
anything to assist you’——</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you will. Thanks, Ridsdale. Don’t
forget that there’s no Dick Dulcimer here. I
am’——</p>

<p>‘The Reverend?’——</p>

<p>‘No; not the Reverend, but plain Mr Golightly.
It may be all very well to play the part of a
curate in a comedietta, but I don’t care to <i>pose</i>
for the character in real life.’</p>

<p>‘But your clerical garb—everybody will take
you for a parson.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help that. If driven into a corner,
I will tell people that I’m a preceptor of youth,
in fact a tutor, which is no more than the truth,
because, you see, I’m teaching Will Hanover to
play the fiddle, so that he’s my pupil and I’m
his tutor.’</p>

<p>‘But what made you choose such an outlandish
name as Golightly?’ asked the other with a
smile.</p>

<p>‘Because Golightly belongs to me, dear boy—it’s
my own property. Know, good my lord,
that my full name is Richard Golightly Dulcimer.
My godfather was Dr Golightly, who’s now
Bishop of Melminster. Many’s the tip I’ve had
from him in the days when I wore a jacket
and turn-down collar. But he wasn’t a bishop
then, and my dad hadn’t lost his fortune, and
things now in that quarter are by no means
what they used to be.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll not forget the name. And now I must
go; I’m expecting an important letter. We shall
meet later on.’</p>

<p>‘For the present, ta, ta,’ said Mr Dulcimer.</p>

<p>‘Sly dog! Never said a word about his own
little affair,’ muttered Dick. ‘Intolerably slow
work waiting here. I wonder how much longer
they’ll be? Ha! happy thought.—Hi!’</p>

<p>The last exclamatory remark was addressed to
a waiter who was in the act of removing an
empty bottle and some glasses from a garden-table
a little way off.</p>

<p>Up came the waiter, a smiling, little, bullet-headed
fellow, French or Swiss, with his black
hair closely cropped, and clean-shaved, blue-black
cheeks and chin.</p>

<p>‘Bring me a pint of bitter beer in a tankard,’
said Richard loftily.</p>

<p>‘Oui, m’sieu.’</p>

<p>He was not away more than a couple of minutes.
Dick was very thirsty, and he seized the tankard
eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Wait,’ he said laconically. Then he blew off
the beads of creamy froth, raised the tankard
to his lips, and slowly and deliberately proceeded
to empty it.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, two ladies, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">{649}</span>
by a maid carrying wraps and umbrellas, came
round a corner of the shrubbery. They had
driven from the station by way of the lower
road, and hence had to walk through a portion
of the grounds in order to reach the hotel.</p>

<p>‘A clergyman, and drinking beer out of a
metal pot!’ exclaimed the elder of the two
ladies. ‘What can the Establishment be coming
to!’</p>

<p>Dick, whose back was towards the party,
gave a great start and nearly dropped the
tankard. ‘The dragon’s voice! I’m caught!’
Then giving the tankard back to Jules, he
said with an affected lisp: ‘Thank you very
much, my friend. On a sultry day like this,
nothing can be more refreshing than a little
iced lemonade.’</p>

<p>‘Lemonade! Ah-ha; monsieur s’amuse,’ murmured
Jules with a slight lifting of the shoulders
as he took back the tankard and marched
away.</p>

<p>‘After all, dear, he was drinking nothing
stronger than lemonade,’ remarked the elder lady,
who was none other than Lady Renshaw, in a
low voice to her niece. ‘No doubt he acquired
the habit of drinking out of pewter while at
college. I am told that they have many strange
customs at the universities, which have been
handed down from more barbarous times.—An
interesting-looking young man.’</p>

<p>‘Very,’ assented Miss Wynter, who had started
at the first sound of Dick’s voice, and was now
looking inquiringly at him. ‘That voice!’ she
said to herself. ‘I could fancy that it was
Dick—I mean Mr Dulcimer, who was speaking.
But that is impossible. And yet’——</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dick had turned, and after gravely
lifting his hat to the ladies, had resumed his
seat, and was now intent again on his book.</p>

<p>Lady Renshaw was a fine, florid specimen of
womanhood, who among her intimate friends
gracefully acknowledged to being thirty-five years
of age, but was probably at least ten years older.
She still retained considerable traces of those
good looks which several years previously had
captured the elderly affections of the late Sir
Timothy. Although her figure might display
a greater amplitude of proportions than of yore,
yet was her hair still black and glossy, her large
dark eyes still as coldly bright as ever they
had been, while if the fine bloom on her cheeks
owed nothing of its tints to the lily, there are
many people who prefer the rich damask of the
rose even in the matter of complexion. Here,
among the Westmoreland hills, her ladyship was
dressed as richly and elaborately as if for a little
shopping in Regent Street or a drive in the Park.
Herein she showed her knowledge of the eternal
fitness of things. Lady Renshaw in a cotton
gown or a seaside wrapper would have looked
little better than a dowdy. Simplicity and she
had nothing in common. But Lady Renshaw
fashionably attired in satins and laces was a
sufficiently good imitation of a lady to pass
current as such with nine people out of every
dozen.</p>

<p>Miss Bella Wynter was a brunette, not very
tall, but with a slender, graceful figure, black,
sparkling eyes, and the sauciest little chin
imaginable. Naturally, she was an unselfish,
generous-hearted girl; but the circumstances of
life and her aunt’s hard worldly training were
doing their best to spoil her. She, too, was
dressed in the extreme of the prevalent fashion,
and looked as if she might just have stepped
out of the show-room of a Parisian <i>modiste</i>.</p>

<p>‘There can be no harm in speaking to him,’
said Lady Renshaw in a low voice to her niece.
‘He may be the son of a bishop or the nephew
of a lord; one never can tell whom one may
encounter at these big hotels.’ Then going
a little nearer to Dick, she said to him: ‘I
presume, sir, that you are staying at the
<i>Palatine</i>?’</p>

<p>Mr Dulcimer started, rose and bowed. ‘For
a day or two, madam, on my way north.’ He
spoke with the same little affected lisp with
which he had addressed Jules the waiter.</p>

<p>‘I’m nearly certain it’s Dick,’ said Bella to
herself with her heart all a-flutter. ‘But what
daring! what effrontery!’</p>

<p>‘Then perhaps you can inform me at what
hour the table-d’hôte takes place?’ said her
ladyship.</p>

<p>Dick knew quite well, but was not going to
tell. ‘I only arrived a couple of hours ago,
madam; but I will at once ascertain.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, no! Greatly obliged to you, but we
are going indoors presently, and can then ascertain
for ourselves.’</p>

<p>‘It <i>is</i> he!’ exclaimed Miss Wynter under her
breath. ‘O Dick, Dick!’</p>

<p>Lady Renshaw had turned, and was gazing
through her eyeglass. ‘Really, my love, the
view from this spot is too utterly exquisite,’ she
said. ‘Such luminosity of atmosphere—such
spontaneity of sunshine! Observe that magnificent
effect of <i>chiaro-oscuro</i> among the hills.
Quite Ruskinesque. I dote on nature—especially
in her wilder moods.’</p>

<p>‘No doubt nature is infinitely obliged to your
ladyship,’ murmured Richard under his breath.</p>

<p>Bella seemed as if she could not keep her
eyes off him. ‘He has shaved off his darling
beard and moustache, and come all this way on
purpose to be near me!’ she mused. ‘Does any
one else care enough for me to do as much as
that? Heigh-ho! why is he so poor?’</p>

<p>‘And now, dear, I think we had better go
indoors,’ said her ladyship blandly. ‘The heat
is somewhat trying.’ Then turning to Dick:
‘We shall probably meet again, Mr—er—Mr—?’</p>

<p>‘Golightly, madam. Mr Richard Golightly,
at your service.’</p>

<p>‘—— At the table-d’hôte, or somewhere, Mr
Golightly.’ This very graciously.</p>

<p>‘I trust, madam, to have the honour,’ and Mr
Dulcimer bowed deeply.</p>

<p>‘O you wicked boy!’ murmured Bella.</p>

<p>‘The old she-dragon suspects nothing,’ said the
wicked boy to himself with a chuckle as soon as
the ladies had turned their backs.</p>

<p>‘A Golightly, my dear,’ remarked Lady Renshaw
to her niece. ‘There are several good
families of that name. One in Devon and
another in York. The young man may be worth
cultivating. I hope you will endeavour to make
yourself agreeable to him.’</p>

<p>‘I will do my best, aunt,’ answered the young
hypocrite demurely.</p>

<p>‘How thankful I am that we have got rid of
that odious Mr Dulcimer!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">{650}</span></p>

<p>Bella’s black eyes danced with mischief; it
was all she could do to keep back a laugh. ‘O
auntie, auntie, if you only knew!’ she whispered
to herself.</p>

<p>When she reached the door of the hotel, she
could not resist turning her head for a parting
look. No one was about, and Dick blew her
a kiss. She blushed, she knew not why, but it
was certainly not with indignation.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ mused Mr Dulcimer with a sigh as he
resumed his seat under the tree; ‘if she won’t
have me, I’ll cut the old country and try sheep-farming
at the antipodes. Capital cure for love,
sheep-farming.’ Taking a pipecase out of his
pocket, he extracted therefrom a highly coloured
meerschaum. ‘Come along, old friend; let you
and me have a confab together. Stay, though,
is it the correct thing for a curate—and I suppose
everybody will insist on taking me for
one—to smoke a meerschaum? Well, if they
don’t do it in public, lots of them do it in
private. Jolly fellows, some curates—others
awful duffers.’ He rose and stretched himself.
‘There must be a quiet nook somewhere among
those trees where a fellow can enjoy a whiff
without the world being the wiser?’ Whereupon
he sauntered away towards the lower part of the
grounds, his hands behind his back and his book
under his arm, totally unaware that his movements
were being watched by a pair of bright
black eyes from an upper window of the hotel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTERVIEWED_BY_A_BUSHRANGER">INTERVIEWED BY A BUSHRANGER.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> staying in Sydney for a few weeks, and
had put up at the <i>Polynesian Club</i>. There I
made the acquaintance of a young colonial
journalist, by name Alison Fellgate, a frank,
clever, easy-going fellow, who had compressed
a good deal of life into his forty years. One
evening after dinner we sat smoking under the
broad veranda that ran round three sides of
the Club building. Presently, Fellgate took out
his watch and held it in his hand for a few
moments. ‘I have an engagement this evening,
but there is plenty of time yet,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I have several times noticed what a particularly
handsome watch that is of yours, Fellgate,’
I said.</p>

<p>‘Ah, that watch has a story,’ he replied.</p>

<p>‘I have observed some sort of inscription on
it. A presentation, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Right. It was a presentation, but of a somewhat
unusual sort.’</p>

<p>‘I grow curious. Let us have the story.’</p>

<p>‘Very good. It is a story I have had to tell
more than once. You must know, then, that I
began my journalistic life in the colonies as
editor of that able and distinguished organ of
public opinion, the <i>Burragundi Beacon</i>. I had
been conducting it for some six months, to the
satisfaction, I am always proud to remember,
of the proprietors, when that outbreak of bushranging
which was headed by the notorious
Frank Gardiner began to keep the country in
a state of continual excitement and terrorism. I
need not tell you that of all the knights of
the bush, Frank Gardiner was in prowess and
achievement second to none. For several years,
he and his gang eluded all efforts at capture
on the part of the government, until the
country-people began to think that Frank, like
his illustrious forerunner and prototype, Dick
Turpin, bore a charmed life. At last, two thousand
pounds was set on his head, alive or
dead.</p>

<p>One morning I received a short letter something
like the following, addressed to the editor
of the <i>Beacon</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>—I observe a statement in the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> of to-day to the effect that
myself and my mates last Monday night attempted
an attack upon Lawson’s Station, Woonara. Will
you allow me the use of your widely-read columns
to say that this announcement is entirely erroneous,
from the simple fact, that on that night
I and my party were busily engaged elsewhere.—I
am, yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Frank Gardiner.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>I was so tickled with this letter—there was
something so funny in its cool audacity, and
the whole circumstances—that I at once inserted
it in the <i>Beacon</i>.</p>

<p>About a fortnight later, I received a second
letter, which ran pretty much like:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>—It must necessarily be the fate of all
public men to encounter much misrepresentation,
and I must just submit, I suppose, like others.
At the same time, when there is a remedy at
hand, a man is merely doing himself justice in
availing himself of that remedy. I appeal, therefore,
simply to your sense of right and fair-play
in requesting you to publish my flat and emphatic
denial to a paragraph which appeared in the
Sydney papers of last Friday—namely, that in
the recent encounter with troopers, one of my
mates was wounded in the arm. Nothing of
the sort took place, thanks to the clumsy shooting
of our opponents. The same paragraph
also states that in the last sticking-up of the
Binda Flat mail we treated our prisoners with
much harshness. The very reverse of this was
the actual case, and this statement can only
have emanated from persons wilfully and maliciously
determined upon prejudicing myself and
my comrades in the public mind.—I remain,
yours, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Frank Gardiner.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>That letter also found a place in the <i>Beacon</i>.
Afterwards I received in all some half-a-dozen
communications from the notorious bushranger,
varying in details, but all of a similar purport—their
object to correct some blunder or misrepresentation
on the part of the public press. All
these communications found a place in the paper.
I saw no harm in thus inserting them. Some of
my readers did not hesitate to accuse me of aiding
and abetting the bushrangers by the publication
of Frank Gardiner’s letters, alleging that they
were merely blinds to lead the police off the
real track. But I reasoned that, even if this
were the case, the ruse was so simple and transparent
a one, that the police were not in the least
likely to fall into it. But I did not think that
Gardiner had any such purpose in sending the
letters. I believed that their meaning was on
the surface, though it sometimes struck me that,
over and above this, the bushranger was himself
aware in some degree of the humour of the situation,
and that his sense of this sometimes shaped
the wording of his letters. Most of the townspeople<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">{651}</span>
took my view of the matter, and laughed
at the thing; and the circulation of the <i>Beacon</i>
in nowise suffered.</p>

<p>I had received, I say, about half-a-dozen of
Mr Gardiner’s communications, covering a space
of ten or twelve weeks, when an event occurred.
I was sitting in my little room about eleven
o’clock at night; I had just finished some
correspondence-work connected with the paper,
and had just lighted a cigar and settled back
into my chair with a Homeric sigh of relief,
when there was a knock at the door; and the
next moment, without waiting for the least
countersign of any sort, a figure entered. I
tipped my chair back until I very nearly lost
my balance at the unexpected aspect presented
by my unceremonious visitor—a tall, athletic
man with a shaggy, light-coloured beard, dressed
in ordinary bushman’s garb, pistols in his belt,
and a carbine at his back, his face hidden by a
mask. Such outwardly was my visitor—a sufficiently
awkward and disquieting figure thus
suddenly to present itself at the dead of night
to a harmless country editor armed with no fire-weapon
more deadly than a cigar. My first
thought was how the fellow had got into the
house; but this and all other thoughts were
quickly dispersed by my new friend addressing
me: “Good-evening, Mr Fellgate.”</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mr—— I beg your pardon;
you have the advantage of me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a little bit of business with you—never
mind my name. I would have sent up my card,
but I’ve forgotten my card-case.”</p>

<p>This symptom of a vein of humour—thin as
it was—in my guest, reassured me a little.</p>

<p>“I am very much at your service, I am sure,”
I replied. “Anything I can do to”——</p>

<p>“That’s it, boss. I was sure you wouldn’t cut
up anyway rough about the business; and we
on our side ’ll try to make it pleasant all round
for you. Well, the business simply is that you’re
to come along with me, Mr Fellgate; and the
sooner we’re off, the better for all parties.”</p>

<p>I did not quite expect this, and my visitor’s
proposal had no great charms.</p>

<p>“You mean that I am to accompany you,
wherever you are going to, now—at once?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. That’s my order. So hurry up,
Mr Editor; and just think of others besides
yourself. My neck’s half-way in the halter at
this blessed moment.”</p>

<p>The man spoke in the coolest and most determined
manner, and I at once saw that any
further attempt at resistance would be worse than
useless.</p>

<p>“One word more, Mr Fellgate,” my companion
continued. “If you follow me quietly and without
any row, no harm will come to you. I
promise you that, on my word as between
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>This should perhaps have been completely
reassuring. Nevertheless, it was with some considerable
feeling of doubt and disquiet that I
prepared to accompany the bushranger, for such
and nothing short the man evidently was. We
left the house noiselessly. The aged lady who
acted for me in the capacity of housekeeper had
long since retired, and our cautious footsteps did
not disturb her. Outside, tethered to a rail-fence
at a little distance from the house, stood two horses.</p>

<p>My companion then blindfolded me, and I
mounted one of the two horses. This blindfolding
again I did not much fancy; but caution
and discretion seemed now to be my safest cue.
When the bushranger had himself mounted, he
caught my horse’s rein, and we started. For
about a quarter of an hour we pursued the high-road
at a quick walk, a jogging, uneasy half-amble,
that was anything but a comfortable pace, the
uneasiness seeming to be increased by my being
blindfolded. Then we suddenly diverged from
the highway, and in a little had entered the bush,
as I could easily judge from the fall of my horse’s
feet on the soft sand-track. I should have
mentioned that the night was a very dark one,
without either moon or stars.</p>

<p>We rode on for the best part of a couple of
hours, very few words passing between us. I
knew the time to be about that length afterwards;
but in reality it seemed much longer to me,
partly, perhaps, from the fact of my being blindfolded;
partly, without doubt, from the whole
conditions of my ride being in no sense what
could be called lively or inspiriting.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours, then, my leader
suddenly tightened my rein, and we drew up.
He bade me descend, which I did, still with the
bandage on my eyes. The next moment my
friend had removed the handkerchief which he
had used for blindfolding me, when a strange
sight met my eyes. I was standing in the middle
of a small clearing in the heart of the forest.
The darkness was lit up by half-a-dozen flaming
torches and the light of a small fire, round which
five or six men were reclining on the short sparse
grass. The man nearest the fire at once caught
my attention. He was about the middle height,
and of a very active and well-proportioned figure;
black-bearded, with particularly bright and alert
eyes, and of not an unprepossessing cast of
features. A few minutes’ scrutiny of the man
confirmed me in my identification of him. He
was no other than my correspondent of the past
three months—the notorious bushranger who
had been harrying the country right and left for
nearly two years, levying black-mail on all whom
he encountered without the slightest respect to
persons or dignities—the redoubtable outlaw,
Frank Gardiner. Various portraits of the man
were abroad throughout the country, all sufficiently
like to enable me to recognise the original,
now that he was before me.</p>

<p>All the men, from the leader downwards, were
armed to the lips, so to speak; and as the light
of the fire and the wavering torches gleamed from
the bright steel of the carbines and pistols to the
bronzed faces of the highwaymen, tanned almost
black by constant exposure to a semi-tropical sun,
I could not but be reminded of the old familiar
stories of Italian banditti and the old pictures one
had seen of the same.</p>

<p>The leader of the gang was the first to speak.
“Good-evening, Mr Fellgate; or rather, good-morning.
You recognise me, I daresay?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think I do.”</p>

<p>“From the several flattering portraits of me
that are about, eh? I wonder you do recognise
me from them, that’s a fact. If ever I catch that
blackguard of a photographer who has so abominably
burlesqued me in those pictures, I engage
to make it lively for him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">{652}</span></p>

<p>It was generally understood that personal
vanity was one of Gardiner’s weaknesses, and
remembering this, I could not help smiling a
little at the speaker’s words.</p>

<p>“You may smile, Mr Editor; but no public man
likes to have such a vile caricature of himself
scattered broadcast over the country; you know
that well enough, and you wouldn’t care about
it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but I haven’t yet attained
enough distinction to be very well able to judge
how I should feel,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Yes; I daresay that makes a difference.—But
to come to business. You’re wondering, I suppose,
why you’ve been brought here in this somewhat
unceremonious fashion?”</p>

<p>“I am a little puzzled.”</p>

<p>“But not afraid, I hope. You don’t look that
way much.”</p>

<p>“No; not now. I was just a little startled at
first, I must confess. But I am not aware of any
wrong I have ever done you, Frank Gardiner.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, my boy—that’s it. On the contrary,
it has been all the other way; and that’s why
I wanted to have a word with you personally.
I wanted to make the nearer acquaintance of
my editor, you know.—How do you think
they read? I mean those letters. Not so
bad for a young aspirant in literature, eh?
I’m positively thinking of getting them reprinted
in a small book, if I can get any of those Sydney
publishing sharps to undertake it. <i>Epistles of a
Bushranger.</i> Taking title, eh?—a fortune in the
very name. Would fetch the public no end,
don’t you think?—But I beg your pardon for
keeping you standing all the time, Mr Editor.
Just bring yourself to anchor; and have a
drink, will you?—Young Hall, hand the editor
your flask.”</p>

<p>A young man, considerably the youngest-looking
of the party, handed me his flask, which I put
to my lips, merely touching the liquor.</p>

<p>“You drink mighty shallow, Mr Fellgate.
One finger’s about your mark, I judge. Well,
please yourself.—Now, look here. There’s a cool
two thousand set on my head; you know all
about that. Well, there’s a carbine by your side,
as pretty a piece as you’ll find this side the range.
Now’s your chance. Take up the gun, and you
can hardly miss me, if you were to try.”</p>

<p>Of course such a thing was totally out of the
question, for more reasons than one. But even
if it had been possible for me to do as the highwayman
suggested, I should have been a fool to
have attempted his life under the existing and
peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>“Just try the weapon, Mr Fellgate. Put it
to your shoulder, and see how it lies as prettily
in rest as a baby asleep. Let it off overhead
there.”</p>

<p>I raised the gun and attempted to fire it,
when I discovered that I was quite unable to do
so. I could not move the trigger a hairbreadth.
It was some kind of trick-lock, the secret of which
was probably known to the owner alone.</p>

<p>Gardiner laughed quietly. “A pretty thing,
ain’t it? But I don’t believe you would have
used the weapon against me just at present, even
if you could—I’ll do you that credit.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” said I, half jocularly.</p>

<p>“Shoot me down like a dingo in a trap? No,
no! A fair field and a chance for his hair even
to an outlaw. That would be more your motto,
Mr Fellgate, I’m sure. Why, I’d grant that
myself even to a trooper, unless the case was
very pressing.—But now, I must really come
to the point.”</p>

<p>During all this colloquy, none of the rest of
the gang had put in a word, but smoked silently
on, regarding me with stolid gravity.</p>

<p>“I have always had a considerable admiration
for the press as an institution,” Gardiner
resumed, “but never so much as since making
your acquaintance as an editor, Mr Fellgate. You
have acted towards me in the most honourable
and gentlemanly manner; and while those
wretched and ignorant Sydney rags the <i>Herald</i>
and <i>Empire</i> have refused to insert my letters
contradicting the many lying and libellous statements
they have published regarding myself and
my mates, you have vindicated the claims of the
press to being a free and impartial organ of public
expression. Now, no man who knows Frank
Gardiner ever accused him of forgetting a friend
or a service. I consider, Mr Fellgate, that you
have done me a real service in this matter, and
acted like a gentleman all round, and I would
like to show you that I am not insensible of this.
Though I am a bushranger, I am not a blackguard.
If you will be good enough to accept
this trifle, just in recognition of my admiration
for you as an editor, and of my personal regard,
you will do me a favour, Mr Fellgate.” As he
spoke, Gardiner took from his breast-pocket a
small morocco case and handed it to me. I
opened the case, and found inside a handsome
gold watch.</p>

<p>Seldom, I venture to think, in the history of
presentations was any one made under more
singular circumstances. It seemed to reverse all
precedent. Tradition was being read backwards;
for instead of a highwayman taking a watch
from me, I was getting one from him. To devise
such a situation in fiction were, of course, easy
enough; but I am relating a true incident, and
as such I am inclined to think that the case
was unique.</p>

<p>Of course, I accepted the watch. What else
could I do? Sticklers for morality may refuse to
indorse my conduct in so doing; but these same
stern moralists would have probably acted precisely
as I did under the same circumstances. I
was by no means so sure of my position that I
could afford to affront or offend my strange friends
in any way. Under that easy sang-froid, careless
banter, and studied politeness which Gardiner
had shown throughout our conversation, I knew
that there remained a will that brooked no
contradiction, and that had never yet been
thwarted. Under circumstances like these, where
personal danger enters as a large factor in determining
our ultimate action, the majority of us
are apt to give an easy and liberal interpretation
to the minor ethics.</p>

<p>I took the watch, uttering some commonplace
words of acceptance in doing so.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr Fellgate, I think our interview
is at an end. I am glad you like the watch,
and I think you will find that it is as good as
it looks. In all probability, you and I will
never meet again. But if ever you hear any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">{653}</span>
of those snivelling city counter-jumpers maligning
me and my brave fellows here, you at
least may kindly think that we’re perhaps not
so black as they paint us.—Jim, take care of the
editor.—Good-night.”</p>

<p>I was once more blindfolded, and Jim and I
returned as we had come. When we reached
the confines of the forest, however, we dismounted,
and my companion removed my bandage.
The first gray glimmer of the dawn was stealing
through the bush.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to walk the rest of the way
home, Mr Fellgate. I’m like the ghost in the
play, you understand—must hook it with the
first light. Sorry I can’t take you to your
door.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it; I know every inch of the
road,” I said, bent upon answering him in the
same vein.</p>

<p>“You’re a pretty cool hand, Mr Editor. Didn’t
think you scribbling chaps were that sort. No
offence. Adieu!”</p>

<p>When I reached my rooms, I found my landlady
already astir. She had not been much
surprised to find my bedroom empty, for it had
once or twice happened that I had to spend the
night at the office, although that was not a
frequent occurrence, the <i>Beacon</i> being only a
bi-weekly issue. I lay down on the sofa in
my sitting-room and took a couple of hours’
sleep. When I awoke, the events of the night
had for a little all the feeling of a dream;
but that fancy quickly passed away. Over my
morning coffee I examined my newly and so
strangely acquired gift at greater leisure. I
may say in conclusion that it has been my constant
companion ever since that night, and I
don’t think there is a better time-keeper out
of London. Would you like to look at it
closer?’</p>

<p>Fellgate handed me the watch. It was a
remarkably handsome hunting-watch, very finely
finished, and bearing the name of a famous
London maker. Inside, I read this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
Presented to <span class="smcap">Alison Fellgate</span>, Esquire,<br />
by<br />
<span class="smcap">Frank Gardiner</span>.
</p>

<p>‘You know all about Gardiner’s ultimate fate,
of course,’ my companion resumed, ‘though you
were not in the colonies at the time—how he
and nearly all his gang were at last taken, and
how Frank himself got a long term. It could
never be proved against him that he had actually
killed any one, and so he escaped the gallows.
He is serving out his time now in Darlinghurst
up there, and behaving himself very decently,
they say.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gardiner, the most notorious highwayman, on
the whole, that ever ranged the Australian bush,
only served a portion of his allotted term. At
the end of that period, Sir Hercules Robinson,
the then governor of New South Wales, exerted
himself to obtain Gardiner’s release from further
imprisonment, believing that the prisoner’s good
conduct from the beginning of his incarceration
deserved this. Many persons thought this course
on the part of Sir Hercules somewhat hasty and
injudicious; and it was not without considerable
opposition and difficulty that the governor had
his way, as he finally did. On his release,
Gardiner betook himself to California, where it
was generally understood that he became the
proprietor of a drinking-bar—a somewhat inglorious
finish to his career.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_REALITIES_OF_RANCHING">SOME REALITIES OF RANCHING.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">FROM A MONTANA CORRESPONDENT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> has lately been written on the subject of
Western Ranching—enough to make the matter
perhaps wearisome to some readers; but I have
not seen any writer touch on the worst side.
Frequently I hear of young fellows, who, attracted
by the tales they have read, are eager
to go West and into ranching. For those
who conduct it properly, there is money in
this business; but let me tell these youngsters
that there is little else in it. At first, everything
is novel; but that soon wears off, and then
for a thoroughly good monotonous life. I know
nothing to compare with it. Life in a log
cabin, with bacon and beans and canned vegetables
for food, and a lot of uneducated cowboys
as daily associates, is not the most fascinating
thing in this world. Your men may be good,
honest, trustworthy fellows; but they are rough
and uncouth in speech and manners, and you
soon get utterly tired of their company.</p>

<p>Your letters, papers, and magazines help, of
course, to while away many a weary hour. Riding
after cattle, branding, &amp;c., is your chief excitement;
but let me say that constant daily work at
that gets monotonous in time. You have some
big-game shooting, always more or less difficult
of access; and you have trout-fishing—successful,
when the fish choose to bite. I have generally
found the best fishing when the weather was
hottest and the mosquitoes thickest. Again,
remember that a small band of cattle does not
return ready cash in proportion to a large
one. Your expenses are greater in proportion,
and the results are liable to discourage
you.</p>

<p>To a lover of scenery, the change from Britain’s
green hills and mossy woods to the dull yellow
browns of the ‘Rockies’ is dispiriting. For a
few weeks in June, a greenish tint pervades the
hillsides, and then, alas! how quickly do the
yellows and browns triumph! I do not write
this to discourage earnest fellows from going
into ranching; but they must not expect—as
many seem to do—that life out West is one
of roses, and that with a small capital to begin
with, they can hunt and fish and have a constantly
jolly time, and in a very few years
come home with a fortune. Life in summer
is endurable; but how about winter? The best
ranges are in the north-western country, and
the winters are simply awful. It has always
been a wonder to me how cattle survive at all,
much less come out in good condition in spring.
How about the nice gentlemanly fellow from
home and home luxuries, enduring a winter
with thermometer ranging from twenty to sixty
degrees <i>below</i> zero! (Two years ago, the spirit
glasses stood in Southern Montana at sixty
degrees below zero for over twenty hours at one
time. Needless to say the mercury glasses were
all frozen <i>solid</i>.) He rides forth on the range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">{654}</span>
to look at his cattle, and comes in, probably,
with nose, cheekbones, hands, and feet nipped,
more or less severely. Next day, he does the
same, with similar results, and then vows he
won’t go again. He remains indoors for a few
days, roasting beside a big stove, gets impatient
at the deadly weariness of his life, and goes
fishing through the ice—catches a few fish;
results same as when riding. He then thinks
he will try deer-tracking, or possibly a little
amateur trapping. In either case he tramps all
day through deep snow, varied by falling into
a hidden spring-hole now and again, getting
wet, and instantly his legs are incased in a solid
mail of ice, which he must break, in order to
walk. He comes home at night tired out,
perhaps with game, more likely without; and
vowing he has had enough of that sort of thing,
falls back on cards and whisky, and so gets
through the winter.</p>

<p>Some fellows have a hazy sort of idea that
by hiring out as cowboys, they eventually will
be, by hook or crook, taken in as partners by
the stock-owner. This is about the greatest
error they can fall into. Nine stockmen out
of ten would not give a new arrival his board
for his services. He cannot ride—I mean, he
cannot <i>sit</i> on one of our quarter-tamed <i>bronchos</i>
much over three minutes; he knows nothing
whatever about the semi-wild habits of Western
cattle, or how to manage them. A <i>good</i> cowboy
requires special knowledge and special points in
his character; and constant daily practice for
years is needed to acquire the one and develop
the others.</p>

<p>Of course, you can do as some of the Cheyenne
fellows do, live practically in town, and let the
ranche run itself. They have an attractive club
and good society there, and lots of the men
make Cheyenne their headquarters. This <i>may</i> be
business, when you own, or manage, large herds,
and when you depend on your foreman to do
the work, while you pose gracefully in front as
a cattle-king; but it is anything but business
where you have only a small band, on the
success of which depends your future. Sternly
and ruefully, you must turn your back on the
delights of town, and manfully determine to stay
up-country and see it through.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="REMAINS_OF_ANCIENT_LONDON">REMAINS OF ANCIENT LONDON.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> constructing the last section of the Metropolitan
(or ‘Underground’) Railway—that expensive
three-quarters of a mile, which it is said
will cost three millions—many curious discoveries
have been made, and many interesting relics
brought to light. The section commences at the
present Mansion House Station, in Cannon Street,
and proceeds nearly east, at a considerable depth,
terminating at the present Tower Hill Station,
and thus completing what is commonly called
the ‘Inner Circle.’ In its course, the railway
tunnel traverses one of the most ancient sites
of the original British-Roman London; and the
discoveries alluded to chiefly refer to that period.
The most important of these has been a very
perfectly built landing-stage or pier, not on the
banks of the Thames, but on the left bank of
Wall Brook, near its confluence with the Thames,
the site being beneath the present Dowgate Hill,
which leads direct to the river. The stage appears
to have been erected with much care and
skill, and is a very superior work. First, the
spot is filled in with oak timber-piling, carefully
bound together; on this is laid a concrete bed,
which, in its turn, supports a Roman tesselated
pavement.</p>

<p>The Wall Brook at that period was doubtless
a stream of some importance, having perhaps a
mouth sufficiently broad to make a sort of useful
harbour, just off the Thames; hence the necessity
of a landing-pier or stage being constructed here
for commercial purposes. Nor is this the only
one of the kind which the railway-works have
brought to light, for a second has been found
beneath Trinity Square Gardens, which are situated
on the spot known as ‘Tower Hill,’ so celebrated
in history as the place of public execution.
This second landing-stage also appears
to have stood on a bank leading to the river,
forming, like the other, a small harbour for
the unloading of craft or landing of passengers.
This stage is built in the same way—timber-piles
supporting a concrete bed, and on this again the
usual Roman tile pavement. But it was observed
that the oak-piling was surrounded by a number
of oak-tree roots, leading to the supposition that
the ground had to be cleared of its original forest
before the building operations of the landing-stage
were begun. This is confirmed by the fact that
the spot where these discoveries were made must
have been outside the eastern boundary of the
original city of London; because a fortress—or
work of some kind—was erected by the Romans
for the protection of the city on that side, on the
site of Gundulph’s still existing ‘Tower,’ and of
course <i>outside</i> the town, and surrounded probably
at that period by the ‘forest primeval.’</p>

<p>The underground track of this part of the
railway has proved a storehouse for relics of both
Roman and medieval times. A great deal of
pottery has been found, as well as articles of glassware,
and even cannon-balls. Two leaden coffins
were brought to light of decided Roman pattern;
also Roman coins. Amongst the many Roman
tiles which were unearthed, one of them bears
the distinct mark of a dog’s foot, which can
only be explained by the animal having walked
over the tile whilst it was still soft after its
manufacture. Two entire skeletons were also
discovered, each head downwards—one in Trinity
Square, and one at the bottom of a well twenty-five
feet below the ground, in Aldgate. The
remains of the windlass which had once been at
the top were also discovered, together with some
pieces of broken pottery. A second well was also
found near the first; but their age has not been
determined.</p>

<p>Below the station at Tower Hill, some timber-piles
were uncovered, which have been stated to
be the remains of the scaffold on which Lords
Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and Lovat suffered in
the last century. But this seems unlikely, as
no doubt the scaffold was removed after the last
execution. But even if it was not, one hundred
and forty years would hardly be sufficient to
bury, many feet below the surface, so large an
article as a timber scaffold. A rare and curious
print, giving a view of Tower Hill on the occasion
of the death of Lord Lovat, shows the scaffold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">{655}</span>
about the middle of the Hill, and consequently to
the south-west of the present station.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, we learn that
‘more unexpected but important evidence’ has
been brought to light of the buildings of ancient
London, by the destruction of the remains of
old London Wall. It had already been noticed
that the foundations of the Roman wall by the
river were made up very much of materials which
had been already used in public buildings, and
near to Tower Hill it has been discovered that
some fine sepulchral monuments have been made
to serve the same purpose. During the further
destruction of the wall, it has been found to have
been partly constructed with stones belonging to
older buildings to a very great extent, some of
the bastions being composed of them. In the
wall in Castle Street, Bevis Marks, sculptured
stones on which are inscriptions are being discovered,
and carefully collected by some zealous
antiquaries, for deposit in the Guildhall Museum.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STRONG-ROOM_AT_PETERBOROUGH">THE ‘STRONG-ROOM’ AT PETERBOROUGH.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already referred (see <i>Journal</i>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65883/65883-h/65883-h.htm#JERRY-BUILDING_IN_THE_MIDDLE_AGES">page
464</a>) to the singular revelation of a regular
system of medieval ‘jerry-building’ found to
have existed in Peterborough Cathedral; and
we have now to record another interesting discovery,
by which the old ‘strong-room’ of the
church has been brought to light. In excavating
for the foundations of the piers of the new
central tower, some ancient masonry was found
deep below the surface, which was at once pronounced
to be the remains of the original Saxon
church, which, together with the monastery, had
been destroyed by the marauding Danes. These
remains indicated that the former church occupied
nearly the position of the present one; and
whilst these antiquarian researches were going
on, speculation was rife as to a certain crypt or
chamber supposed to exist close under the floor
of the present church, as indicated by Gunton,
who wrote the History of the cathedral not very
long after its narrow escape from the hands of
Cromwell’s soldiers.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a careful search was made by
Dean Perowne and the clerk of the works,
to the north of the great central tower, and
bordering on the south end of the north transept;
when the accuracy of their calculations
was proved, and their labours rewarded by the
discovery, immediately under the pavement, of
an underground chamber measuring six feet
three inches in length, by four feet wide, and
six feet high. A curved flight of steps rises from
one side of the chamber, whilst a straight flight
leads off at one end, and both ascend directly
to the floor of the church above. The vault was
found to be filled with all sorts of apparent
rubbish in stone and metal. On close inspection,
however, much of this proved to be parts of
the choir-screen, which, from its great beauty,
had been the glory of the church and the
admiration of historians for centuries, but which,
at the sacking of the church by Cromwell’s
soldiers in 1643, had been pulled to the ground
with ropes, and then smashed to pieces. The
rest of the contents consisted of pieces of stone,
forming parts of what had once been, apparently,
a reredos; bits of stained glass, which lost
their colour on exposure to the air; fragments
of broken swords and pikes; pieces of leathern
scabbards; bits of charred wood; and a quantity
of bones of animals, probably sheep, which had
been used for food.</p>

<p>On the chamber being cleared and closely
examined, competent authorities pronounced the
floor to be much older work than the rest of the
vault, and it is not impossible that this might
have been part of the floor of the original Saxon
church. It was composed of large flags, several
of which had been violently disturbed, possibly
by Cromwell’s looters, in their search for spoil,
and in the thought of finding another hidden
chamber still lower down. Whether or not they
found any valuables does not appear to be known;
but the supposition is that they did not, or it
would have been referred to by contemporary
historians.</p>

<p>Opinions seem divided as to the use of this
vault. The more general opinion appears to
be that it was nothing more or less than the
‘strong-room’ of the monastery. In medieval
times, secrecy was often more trusted in than locks
and bars; for the latter, force and patience might
ultimately overcome; but a hidden secret would
be a secret still; and in the present instance,
as there was not the smallest outward indication
of the existence of such a chamber, so long as
the secret was kept inviolate, the chamber and
its contents were safe. All the facts in connection
with this interesting discovery being
taken into careful consideration, the conclusion
may be safely arrived at, that this chamber
or vault was indeed the ‘strong-room’ or ‘safe,’
contrived and cleverly concealed centuries ago,
beneath the floor of the great cathedral, for
the purpose of containing the money and treasures
belonging to the community of the monastery
of Peterborough, and now so unexpectedly
laid open to the eager gaze of admiring
antiquaries and architects of this present year of
grace 1884. Perhaps discoveries of still deeper
interest are in store for us from amongst the
foundations of this grand medieval fane.</p>

<h3>BURNS AND SCALDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are very few homes whose inmates have
not at some time or other suffered more or less
severely from the effects of a burn; there are
few persons who ever forget the severity of the
pain that succeeds a bad burn; and yet there are
very few who make any provision for the proper
treatment of such wounds. This neglect arises
from indifference or from ignorance, but chiefly
the latter. A burn treated in time does not take
nearly so long to heal, and generally heals better
than it otherwise would. The object of the
present paper is to make familiar a few of the
remedies which are generally applied to burns—remedies
so simple in themselves that they
can be applied by any person.</p>

<p>The best thing to apply to a burned or scalded
part is Carron oil spread on lint or linen. The
main object in the treatment of a burn is to keep
the affected part out of contact with the air; but
the part of the treatment to which our attention
should be first directed is that which will lessen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">{656}</span>
or remove the pain. Ice or cold water is sometimes
used; and sometimes water moderately
warm, or a gentle heat, gives relief. Carron oil—so
called from the famous Carron ironworks,
where it is extensively used—not only lessens the
immediate pain, but covers the part with a film
which effectually shuts out the air and prevents
the skin getting dry.</p>

<p>This Carron oil can be prepared in a very
simple way. It consists of equal parts of olive
oil and lime-water. Olive oil, or salad or Lucca
oil, is the oil best suited for the purpose; but if
not easily obtainable, linseed oil answers the purpose
very well. Lime-water can be easily made
by any one, if it cannot be procured otherwise.
About a teaspoonful of the lime used by builders—if
the purer kind is not obtainable—added to
a pint of water and well shaken, is all that is
required. It is then allowed to settle, and the
water when required is drawn off without disturbing
the sediment at the bottom. Pour the oil on
the lime-water, stir or shake well, and the mixture
is ready for use. It is poured freely between two
folds of lint, or the lint dipped in the mixture;
the lint applied to the wound, and held in position
by a bandage. The wound may be dressed twice
a day; but in dressing, the wound should be
exposed to the air the shortest possible time. If
the lint adheres to the wound, it must not be
pulled off, but first moistened thoroughly with
the oil, when it comes off easily. In some cases,
it is not advisable to remove the lint. Under
such circumstances, the best way to proceed is
to lift up one fold of the lint, drop the oil within
the folds, replace the fold as before, and secure
the bandage. Carron oil is one of those things
that no household should be at any time without.</p>

<p>Considering the simplicity of the cure, how
easily olive oil and lime-water can be obtained,
let us hope that for the sake of relieving even a
few minutes’ pain, no reader of this paper will be
in the future without a bottle of Carron oil.</p>


<h3>INTERESTING DISCOVERY AT ROME.</h3>

<p>A beautiful statue of Bacchus has recently
been discovered in a hollow place beneath the
staircase in the library at Hadrian’s Villa, Rome.
It represents the god not as the coarse dissipated
old man, but according to his later aspect, as a
beautiful effeminate youth. It is singularly well
preserved, the right hand only being missing.
Its great beauty was at once recognised, and
casts were immediately made, one of which is
at Berlin, another at Strassburg, and a third in
the new Cast Museum of Sculpture at Cambridge.
The statue represents a youth standing with the
weight of the body thrown on the right leg; the
right hand is raised, and held, it is supposed, the
two-handled wine-cup or <i>kantharos</i> of Bacchus.
Over the right shoulder is thrown a <i>nebris</i> (fawn-skin),
which falls back and front with studied symmetry.
A question has arisen amongst the learned
on these subjects as to whether this beautiful work
of ancient art is itself an original, or a copy in
marble from a bronze original. And then comes
the still more important inquiry, what is its
date? Professor Michaelis—a noted authority—states
his opinion that ‘the statue is a work of
the eclectic school, the post-Alexandrian manner
which selected and combined, and advisedly
imitated, the style of bygone manners, which
sought to revive the manner of the best Attic
and Argive work;’ and which the learned professor
fancies he can discern by certain peculiar
appearances and treatment, and a want of harmony
in many minute details, which, however,
could hardly occur to any ordinary spectator, who
sees before him simply an exquisitely finished
and beautiful work of antique art.</p>


<h3>TELEPHONING EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>

<p>The most remarkable piece of telephoning yet
attempted has been just accomplished by the
engineers of the ‘International Bell Telephone
Company,’ who successfully carried out an experiment
by which they were enabled to hold a
conversation between St Petersburg and Bologæ,
a distance of two thousand four hundred and
sixty-five miles. Blake transmitting, and Bell
receiving, instruments were used, and conversation
was kept up notwithstanding a rather high
induction. The experiments were carried on
during the night, when the telegraph lines were
not at work. The Russian engineers of this
Company are so confident of further success
that they hope shortly to be able to converse
with ease at a distance of four thousand six hundred
and sixty-five miles; but to accomplish
this astonishing feat they must combine all the
conditions favourable for the transmission of
telephonic sounds. If it is found possible to
hold audible conversation at such extraordinary
distances, it is possible that this fact will be
speedily improved upon, and we shall be enabled
to converse freely between London and New
York, and by-and-by between London and the
antipodes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
